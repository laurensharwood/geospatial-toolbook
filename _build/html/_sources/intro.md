# Geospatial-ToolBook Introduction


Welcome! I've assembled this book intending to i) support equitable access to information and ii) promote geographic information's use across disciplines, by providing the tools for anyone to utilize the vast and increasing amount of geospatial data that exists today. As such, I try to highlight free resources (i.e. publicly-available data and open-source tools) that I've used or know to be industry standard. Because the industry and my experiences are both constantly evolving, this book will be as well.  

You can also find code I've used over the last few years at my [Geospatial-Toolbox repository](https://github.com/laurensharwood/geo-tlbx/).
