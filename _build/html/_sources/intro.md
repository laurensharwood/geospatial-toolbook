# Geospatial-ToolBook Introduction


Welcome! The purpose of this book is to support equitable access to geographic information and its use across disciplines, by providing anyone with little-to-no experience in GIS or IT the ability to utilize the vast & increasing amount of geospatial data that exists today.

You can also find code I've used over the last few years at my [Geospatial-Toolbox repository](https://github.com/laurensharwood/geo-tlbx/).  


Check out each chapter to learn more.
