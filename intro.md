# Geospatial-ToolBook Introduction


Welcome! This book is intended to i) support equitable access to information and ii) promote geographic information's use across disciplines, by providing the tools for anyone to utilize the vast & increasing amount of geospatial data that exists today. As such, I try to highlight free, publicly-available data and open-source tools that I've used and/or know to be industry standard. Further, because the industry and my experience are both constantly evolving, this book will be as well.  

You can also find code I've used over the last few years at my [Geospatial-Toolbox repository](https://github.com/laurensharwood/geo-tlbx/).
